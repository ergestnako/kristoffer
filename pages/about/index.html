      <p>Hey. I’m Kris. I'm an interactive designer / developer.</p>

      <p>I’m originally from Umeå in northern Sweden, but I now live in Brooklyn, NY. I am currently the Lead Product Engineer at a small startup called Nomad Health. Before that, I was a Product (Engineering) Manager at Tumblr. Before that, I worked at agencies. Before that, I was a baby.</p>

      <p>I like to design things, and then I like to build those things.</p>

      <p>I occasionally take on freelance projects. Feel free to get in touch if you have an interesting project that you want to collaborate on. Or if you just want to say hello, that's cool too.</p>
